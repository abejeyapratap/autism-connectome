This folder contains the example use of brain match code to generate network anomaly score (NAS).

In this experiment I use TBI data of Hoon. We use structural connectomes, that are generated using 500 seeds per voxel, probabilistic tractography. Details of the dataset and of all experiments can be found in "Osmanlioglu, Y., Parker, D., Alappatt, J.A., Gugger, J.J., Diaz-Arrastia, R.R., Whyte, J., Kim, J.J. and Verma, R., 2021. Connectomic Assessment of Injury Burden and Longitudinal Structural Network Alterations in Moderate-to-severe Traumatic Brain Injury. bioRxiv."

1) This use of the code involves matching every subject with everyone else to get a subjectwise matching score.
2) Python scripts post process the output of the matching code to get a NAS score for each subject, by calculating the average matching score of individuals relative to the healthy controls.
3) We then calculate group difference between patients and controls regarding their NAS score
4) Finally we show that the NAS score declines with time, by using a mixed linear effects model (code in R)
